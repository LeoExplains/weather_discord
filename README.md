# Weather Discord Bot 
Version 1.0

### Short description
A bot that takes a users input, prints options for possible locations, and then returns the weather based on Open Weather Map API response. 

## Commands
Prints todays weather forcast for a location
```
!today
```
Prints tomorrows weather forcast for a location
```
!tomorrow
```
## Logic
If chance of rain > 60% it will recommend an `umbrella`
If UV index is over 3 it will recommend `hat`. `sunscreen`

## Resources Used
* [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) - Weather data
* [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Discord library for python

### Usage example

![screenshot of bot today command](example.jpg)

## Build Notes
Currently hosted locally / in IDE so not always online. 

API supports lots of features for future expansion. 

First attempt at using discord.py.

### Improvements
‚≠ï Add unit tests

‚≠ï Reformat location choice selection into a reusable function. Current issue with api response taking too long then raising an exception for the next command.

‚≠ï Reformat commands from message.startswith to @bot.commands

‚≠ï Check if there are any forks needed for discord.py to keep working

‚≠ï Reformat emojis to be general unicode rather than discord specific emoji names for better compatibility

‚≠ï Create docker image for bot

‚≠ï Find hosting for the bot

## Future Features
‚úÖ Up to 7 days forcasts (supported in the api & handler I wrote for api data, just not as a command yet)

‚úÖ Checking for wind speed / gusts and recommending a windbreaker

‚úÖ Recommending to stay inside in extreme weather (Thunderstorm, Snow, Extreme Heat)

‚úÖ Emoji's for the description field e.g [Light clouds üå§Ô∏è]

‚úÖ Pollution / Smoke forcast feature

‚úÖ Options for text output (short, regular, long)

‚úÖ Port to a slack bot
